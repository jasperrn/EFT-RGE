The renormalizable theory of the O(N) model is defined through the Lagrangian

$$
   L = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \phi \cdot \partial^\mu \phi
         -\frac{\mu^{2\epsilon}}{4!} \lambda (\phi\cdot\phi)^2
$$\phantom{.}

The beta function is defined as 

$$
   \beta_\lambda = \mu \frac{d}{d\mu} \lambda = -2\epsilon \lambda + O(\lambda^2)
$$\phantom{.}

The anomalous dimension of the field is defined by

$$
   \gamma_\phi\,\phi = - \mu \frac{d}{d\mu} \phi = O(\lambda^2)
$$

The anomalous dimension of the field is stored under dim1spin0.

We provide the beta function and anomalous dimension of the field up to five loops. Seven loop results exist in the literature, see [Schnetz 1606.08598].
